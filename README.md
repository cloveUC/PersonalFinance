Hello all,
This is my first public Github project that I am using to test and understand the basics of Github.
This project is mainly to practice the uses and strengths of Github while also displaying use of Python for my own personal use.
I will continue to update this project as my knowledge grows.
Uses:
This program allows a user to enter in their expenses to see their totals and display all expenses.
This program also allows the user to save their data in a csv file and to load the data as well for continuous use and tracking of expenses.

Future plans:
-Categorization of expenses
-Totals based off of category
-Graphs/Charts to visualize spending
-Ability to add income, to track if over spending or saving
-Possiblity of stock tracking
-Better GUI for a better look and user expierience

Thank you, if you have any questions please reach out.
